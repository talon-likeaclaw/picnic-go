# PicnicGo

## Rules

[Picnic Go](https://www.freeboardgames.org/en/play/picnicGo) is a simple deck-building game similar to [Sushi Go](https://gamewright.com/pdfs/Rules/SushiGoTM-RULES.pdf), where you try to make the most delicious meal from a deck of 108 cards containing 10 picnic treats and forks!! Each round, players will take turns chosing a card from their Moving Hand for their set hand. Moving hands rotate after each player picks a card. At the end of each round, each player's set hand's points are calculated and then discarded. New moving hands are automatically drawn from the deck. The game ends when three rounds have been completed. The player with the most points after three rounds wins! If there is a tie, everyone wins!!
